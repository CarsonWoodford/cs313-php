    	<h3>Coding</h3>
        One of my favorite things is coding. It's the reason I became a computer science major, 
        and I have been doing it since I was 13 years old. There are few things as exhillerating 
        as seeing code run successfully, and I spend much of my time working on personal projects
        such as a sudoku solver I recently began. There is so much to learn when coding, and I
        almost always find better ways to accomplish tasks each time I code.</p>

    	<h3>Modeling</h3>
        <p class="textblock">
        Not for magazines, unfortunately.<br>
        One of my early coding focuses was video games. Unfortunately, games without visuals weren't
        very appealing, and free assets online either don't match art styles or simply just
        weren't what I was looking for. So I decided to make my own, and have grown to love 3D
        modeling. I personally use Blender, an open source program with immense potential.
        Using both box modeling and sculpting, along with the new principaled BSDF shader and 
        Filmic, 3D models have never been so accessable with such high quality. I look forward 
        to Eevee, Blender's upcoming realtime engine.</p>

    	<h3>Circus Skills</h3>
        <p class="textblock">
        Surprisingly, I don't spend every waking moment in front of my computer. At least one
        I spend doing something else. For me, that something else often is a circus skill.
        When I was twelve years old my parents took me to see Cirque Du Sol, or something with
        a similar name, and I decided to learn what I could. Now I have learned to ride a
        unicycle, do a simple poi dance, throw knives, and juggle. I can juggle four balls, or
        three clubs/knives. I have a scar on my left hand, a reminder of why you should only
        juggle properly weighted knives.</p>
