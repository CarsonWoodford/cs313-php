    	<h3>Coding</h3>
        <p class="textblock">
        One of my favorite things is coding. It's the reason I became a computer science major, 
        and I have been doing it since I was 13 years old. There are few things as exhillerating 
        as seeing code run successfully, and I spend much of my time working on personal projects
        such as a sudoku solver I recently began. There is so much to learn when coding, and I
        almost always find better ways to accomplish tasks each time I code.</p>
